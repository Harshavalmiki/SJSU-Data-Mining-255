**Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and Applications in Data Analysis**
**Introduction:**
In this colab, we will explore various dimensionality reduction techniques and their applications in data analysis. We will cover traditional methods such as PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, and LLE, along with modern approaches like UMAP and t-SNE. The primary focus will be on UMAP, and we will showcase its implementation for visualization, hyperparameter tuning, clustering, and feature extraction.


(**Task a):**

**PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, and LLE** will be implemented and compared for dimensionality reduction.
Visualizations will be generated to showcase the effectiveness of each technique.
Techniques for selecting hyperparameters will be discussed and applied.
Modern Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (Task b):

**UMAP and t-SNE** will be implemented with a focus on UMAP.
Proper visualization using UMAP visualizer will be emphasized.
Screenshots of UMAP visualizations will be provided.
